# 🌊 Hong Kong River Water Quality Dashboard (1986–2020)

## 📖 Overview
This Power BI project visualizes long-term water quality data from rivers across Hong Kong.  
It explores key environmental parameters — **pH**, **Temperature**, and **Dissolved Oxygen (DO)** — from 1986 to 2020.

The dashboard provides insights into how these parameters fluctuate across regions and time, revealing patterns that reflect environmental health and potential pollution sources.

- **Key Columns:**
  - `River` — River name or monitoring station
  - `Year` — Year of measurement
  - `pH` — Acidity/alkalinity indicator
  - `DO` — Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)
  - `Temperature` — Water temperature (°C)

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Power BI  
- Power Query (for cleaning & transformation)  
- DAX (for calculated measures)  
- Excel / CSV (dataset format)

---

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
- **pH Levels:** Stayed within neutral range (6.5–7.5) for most rivers.
- **Dissolved Oxygen:** Declined gradually after 2010, hinting at mild organic pollution.
- **Temperature:** Slight upward trend correlating inversely with DO levels.
- **Regional Patterns:** Some rivers show consistent quality, while others indicate degradation.
